# Exploring Trends in the Startup Funding ecosystem: A Data Analysis (2018-2021)

# Introduction

In the world of startups, success doesn't rest solely on the shoulders of the founder. It's a team effort, and it extends beyond the company itself to benefit the development of the entire country. As the saying goes, 'you're not just funding a startup, you're sowing the seeds of national progress.' 

As a trainee working on this project, our mission is to unravel the complexities of the Indian startup ecosystem from 2019 to 2021. We are like explorers, navigating through a vast dataset that contains invaluable information about startup funding. Our main objective is to dissect this data, paying close attention to industry sectors, funding stages, geographical locations, and the intricate profiles of the companies involved. 

Through our analysis, we aim to unearth profound insights that can illuminate the path for investment decisions. This means helping both established investors and budding entrepreneurs make informed choices in the world of startups. Moreover, our discoveries will enrich the collective knowledge of the startup landscape.
