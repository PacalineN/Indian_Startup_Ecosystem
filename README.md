## Project Overview
Welcome to our project, "Exploring Trends in the Indian Startup Funding Ecosystem." Here, we delve deep into the Indian startup landscape, conducting a thorough analysis of data spanning from 2019 to 2021. Leveraging the power of Python and data visualization through Power BI, we, as data analysts in this venture, aspire to uncover captivating trends within the expansive funding landscape of Indian startups. Join us on this exploration as we unravel the story behind the numbers, shedding light on the intricate patterns that have shaped the financial journey of startups in India during this critical period. 
## Data sources 
The data sources for this project are attributed to aAzubi Africa, providing access to information in three distinct parts. The initial dataset, encompassing data for 2020 and 2021, was securely stored in a database, accessible remotely. The second dataset, pertaining to the year 2019, was obtained from OneDrive. The final dataset, covering the year 2018, was sourced from a GitHub repository and was available in CSV format.

## Tools Used
- Python 
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- PowerBI for crafting data visualizations and constructing dashboards


## Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase,I performed the following tasks : 
1. Data loading and inspectation
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

## Exporatory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding the Netflix dataset, uncovering patterns, trends, and insights. In this section, I explore various aspects of the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the content available on Netflix, addressing key questions:

1. **Release Trends Over the Years:**
   - In which year did the highest number of TV shows and movies release? (Visualized using a Bar Graph)

2. **Movies and TV Shows by Top 10 Directors:**
   - Show all records where the category is "Movie" and type is "Comedians" or the country is "United Kingdom." Additionally, display the top 10 directors who gave the highest number of TV shows and movies to Netflix. (Visualized using a Bar Graph)

3. **Different Ratings Defined by Netflix:**
   - What are the different ratings defined by Netflix?
     
## Results 

The Netflix dataset analysis reveals significant trends. The year 2019 stands out with the most releases, marking a pivotal moment in Netflix content production. Ra√∫l Campos, Jan Suter, and Marcus Raboy lead in directorial contributions, emphasizing their impact on Netflix's diverse content landscape. The dataset's ratings, encompassing 'TV-MA,' 'R,' 'PG-13,' etc., showcase the platform's commitment to varied content suitability. The United States dominates TV show contributions, emphasizing its global influence. A concise bar graph illustrates the distribution of movies and TV shows, highlighting insights into content diversity.
